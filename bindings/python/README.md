# AccessKit

These are the bindings to use AccessKit from Python.

Documentation for the Rust packages can be found [here](https://docs.rs/accesskit/latest/accesskit/).

## Building

If there are no wheels available for your platform, you will have to build one yourself. You will need to have Rust installed on your system, so that the native libraries can be compiled. Please visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) for instructions on how to proceed.
